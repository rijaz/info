				<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
				<p>I am currently a junior studying Computer Science at <a1>Boston University</a1> with an expected graduation date of May 2018. Looking for any internship opportunity to gain experience, work with awesome people and learn some more awesome coding skills!</p>
				<p>I was introduced to Computer Science when I was a biology major through Python my freshman. I fell in love with Computer Science through the class' assignments - our final project was to write a simple version of a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-a-computer-program-helped-show-jk-rowling-write-a-cuckoos-calling/"><a2>program</a2></a> that would compare texts to reveal if it was written by the same author! </p>
				<p>I later learned Java, C, Haskell, SQL and R and taught myself CSS and HTML! </p>
				<p>I'm currently working on three class projects: </p>
				<p> 1. A web application as part of a team called <a3>Couch Potato</a3> using Django/Python. <a3>Couch Potato</a3> would allow users to search a movie and be given a list of viewing options based on their current subscriptions to viewing sites such as Netflix, Hulu, etc. instead of having to individually check all the sites</p>
				<p> 2. A final project for my Introduction to Databases and Data Mining class that requires a team of 3 people to mine data from a site and represent the data in a presentation. Topic and specifics TBD!</p>
				<p> 3. An android app as part of a team in Global App Initiative for <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.com/"> <a4>Freedom House </a4></a>. The app would send reminders to users about the colleges that they hope to apply to and would connect them to advisors via a chat.</p>

				<h4>What else?</h4>
				<p> I'm part of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BUOPS/"> Organization of Pakistani Students </a>(OPS) at Boston University. I previously held the co-Public Relations chair where I was in charge of making dope flyers for events that we hosted. Currently, I'm their Extrnal Affairs Coordinator so I send emails out to other student groups and organizations in the Greater Boston Area for potential collaborations. I actually got to meet Khizr Khan recently when he spoke at an event we co-hosted with the Association of Pakistani Physicians of New England! Our mgoal is to raise awareness about Pakistani culture and traditions and celebrate it with our peers! </p>
				<p>I love visiting state and national parks and I hope to see as many as I can. So far the counter is 2: Franconia State Park in New Hampshire 2015 and Acadia National Park in Maine in 2016. This years destination is still TBD!</p>
				<p>I occasionally paint! When I was younger I <b>loved</b> animation probably due to the fact that i was born in the late 90's when all the Disney Classics were being released or maybe just because those movies were <b>awesome</b>. I actually briefly wanted to be an animator at Disney and I loved recreating Disney characters myself. Now, I use it as an outlet to unwind and relax! </p>
				<p> I'm a huge Tolkienhead (geeky, I know) - I'm slowly working my way through every book written by JRR Tolkien. Its actually one of the first live-action movies I actually remember watching. Next stop: The Histories of Middle Earth but I'm currently reading All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr.</p>
